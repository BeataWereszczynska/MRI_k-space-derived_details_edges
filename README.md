## The repository contains:
1. Python script kspace_det_edg.py.
2. [COMING SOON] PDF file presenting:
- short introduction to the topic,
- how the code works step by step,
- sample results with commentary.
3. Sample FID data in the sems_20190203_03.fid folder.
4. Sample results illustrations in FigureA.png and FigureB.png.
